# Ship_routing_QLearning

Implemented Q learning from scratch to determine the optimal ship route considering static weather conditions and proximity to land.
This doesn't currently work as intended. Hoping to correct it soon.

To do:
- [ ] Figure out the error in and correct Q learning functioning
- [ ] Modify to include dynamic weather conditions (How, I have no idea).
